//In this class we are going to discuss about Polymorphism
//Poly - means Many and Forms - called Poly Forms == Polymorphism
//Polymorphism - Run in 2 types - Method Overloading & Method Overriding
//Method Overloading - Compile Time & Early Binding
//Method Overriding - Run Time & Late Binding

//Polymorphism - E.g. - Same method [Add(), Add(int a, int b), Add(int a, int b, int c)

//Signature - This is also one of the concept to understand the Polymorphism
//Signature - means Number of Argument or Parameters we passed (also refer the above example for number of arguments)
//Java - normally not allowed to create a method in same name
//However - Method can be overloading if and only if method has the same name but with different signature
